<h1>My top 3 Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>The favourites of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Count of Montecristo</h3>
</p> This is one of my all time favourite films as it combines swashbuckling adventures with tale of revenge and redemption with fantastic acting <p/>

<h3>Ever After</h3>
<p/> A classic tale reimagined without the magic, a feminist empowering version of cinderella <p/>

<h3>The pirates of the carribean series</h3>
<p> I'm a big fan of the first 3 films, as a child i love pirates, ships and swordfighting and this combines all</p>
